title: About Us

Research Triangle Analysts is a unique forum for data enthusiasts in the Research Triangle of North Carolina (Raleigh, Durham, Chapel Hill, and the surrounding area).

Our mission is to promote the use of data techniques to enable meaningful analysis and effective communication for the benefit of the community. We want to provide a unique resource among analytical collaborative networks – with a focus on the methods and outcome rather than the tool. This can be an extremely valuable experience to analysts, allowing insightful exchanges among integrated professionals who would otherwise be limited by a siloed approach. Originally founded in 2012 by a subset of multidisciplinary professional analysts, our group has grown dramatically and now includes hundreds of members. We hold monthly local meetings, open to all, that span a variety of formats including relaxed networking, coding sessions, invited speakers and panel discussions.

RTA is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit. Monthly meetings are free of charge. We do charge a nominal fee for Analytics>Forward, the yearly unconference, and may charge for other events where we provide food, in order to reduce no-shows. Money from these events are used to help support RTA activities. Purchaser grants Research Triangle Analysts sole discretion regarding the use of this payment to help support its activities.

We encourage you to join us, to visit our social networking presence, and to take advantage of the resources and calendar of upcoming events on the site. If you would like to know more about our group or how you can get involved, please feel free to email us at info@rtpanalysts.org. We look forward to meeting you!
